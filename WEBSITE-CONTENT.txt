SECTION: Meta Fields

Client: Daedalus Productions
Role: Art Director
Year: 2025 -- Present
Status: In Production

SECTION: The Challenge
---
Label: The Challenge
Heading: A documentary that needed a visual language as unflinching as its subjects.
Paragraph 1: [ITALIC]They Fight With Cameras[/ITALIC] tells the story of war photographers who shaped how the world sees conflict. The film demanded an art direction that honoured the gravity of its subject without becoming sentimental or overwrought.
Paragraph 2: Daedalus Productions approached me to define the visual identity of the campaign -- from title design to promotional materials, festival submissions, and the broader narrative architecture that would carry the documentary from screen to audience.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Restraint as a form of respect.
Paragraph 1: The visual system builds on contrasts: [BOLD]silence against noise[/BOLD], [BOLD]stillness against chaos[/BOLD]. We developed a typographic-led identity using stark black-and-white photography, precise editorial framing, and a restrained colour palette that lets the subject matter speak.
Paragraph 2: Every design decision was guided by one principle: the photographers are the heroes, not the design. The visual language serves the story -- never competes with it.
Quote: The best art direction disappears. It creates conditions for the story to land.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A visual system built for longevity.
Paragraph 1: The campaign identity has been adopted across all touchpoints -- title sequences, press kits, festival submissions, social media, and merchandise. It provides a cohesive visual backbone that adapts to each format while maintaining the film's emotional integrity.
Paragraph 2: As the documentary moves through production and into distribution, the identity system continues to evolve -- always guided by the same principles of editorial restraint and narrative clarity.

Result 1 Number: 12+

SECTION: The Challenge
---
Label: The Challenge
Heading: A respected practice that needed to feel as warm as it is precise.
Paragraph 1: A respected radiology practice in northern Germany needed to modernise its brand without losing the trust and authority it had built over 15 years. Their visual identity felt clinical and cold -- patients found it impersonal.
Paragraph 2: The task was clear: bridge the gap between medical expertise and human connection, creating a brand that patients could trust [BOLD]and[/BOLD] feel welcomed by.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Precision and warmth are not opposites.
Paragraph 1: We started with deep listening sessions with the founding radiologists and their team. The insight: [BOLD]precision and warmth are not opposites[/BOLD]. The new brand positions the practice as technically excellent AND deeply human.
Paragraph 2: The visual identity uses clean medical confidence paired with warm, inviting tones. Every element -- from typography to colour palette to photography direction -- was designed to communicate both authority and approachability.
Quote: Precision in medicine. Warmth in care. The brand needed to hold both truths at once.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A brand system built for trust and growth.
Paragraph 1: A complete brand system including new visual identity, patient-facing communications, signage system, digital presence guidelines, and internal brand manual. The practice reported a 30% increase in patient referrals within 3 months.
Paragraph 2: The new identity unified every patient touchpoint -- from the moment they visit the website to the experience of walking through the doors -- creating a coherent, reassuring presence that reflects the quality of care inside.

SECTION: Results

Label: Impact
Heading: The numbers behind the transformation.
Result 1 Number: 30%
Result 1 Description: Increase in patient referrals within three months of the rebrand launch

Label: The Challenge
Heading: A care company built on compassion -- but invisible in a crowded market.
Paragraph 1: A home care company in Hamburg providing daily assistance to elderly and mobility-impaired clients. The founder, Lisa Mueller, had built the business on genuine compassion -- but the brand looked generic, indistinguishable from dozens of other care services in the region.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Preserving independence, not replacing it.
Paragraph 1: The Brand Sprint uncovered a powerful differentiator: LM Alltagshilfe doesn't just provide care -- they [BOLD]preserve independence[/BOLD]. Every service is designed to help clients maintain their daily routines, not replace them.
Paragraph 2: The new brand narrative centres on [BOLD]dignity, autonomy, and the quiet heroism of everyday life[/BOLD]. Visual identity uses warm, human photography and a colour palette that feels like home -- not a hospital.
Quote: Care isn't about doing things for people. It's about making sure they can still do things for themselves.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A brand that feels like home.
Paragraph 1: A warm, distinctive brand that immediately set LM Alltagshilfe apart in a crowded market. New website, print materials, staff uniforms, and vehicle branding -- all speaking the same language of dignified independence.

SECTION: The Challenge
---
Label: The Challenge
Heading: A consulting firm with sharp thinking trapped inside a forgettable brand.
Paragraph 1: Steen Digital is a Hamburg-based consulting firm specialising in operational transformation for mid-market companies. The founders -- two ex-McKinsey partners -- had deep expertise but their brand felt like every other consulting firm: blue, corporate, forgettable.
Paragraph 2: They needed a brand that reflected their contrarian, founder-friendly approach.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Rigour without rigidity.
Paragraph 1: Through the Brand Sprint, we identified Steen Digital's core tension: [BOLD]rigour without rigidity[/BOLD]. Unlike traditional consultants who impose frameworks, Steen Digital works from within -- embedding with founders to reshape operations from the inside.
Paragraph 2: The new brand uses bold, architectural typography and a muted earth-tone palette. The visual system conveys structure and precision, but with enough warmth to feel approachable.
Quote: Strategy without empathy is just a spreadsheet. The brand needed to feel as sharp as their thinking -- and as human as their method.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A brand that became a client acquisition tool in itself.
Paragraph 1: Complete brand overhaul including positioning statement, visual identity, website, pitch materials, and internal templates. The rebrand coincided with a pivot to focus exclusively on founder-led businesses, and the new brand became a client acquisition tool in itself.

Label: The Challenge
Heading: An advisory firm with decades of expertise but no brand to match.
Paragraph 1: Decarbonaid is a decarbonization advisory firm with decades of experience in strategic and financial corporate management, as well as asset & investment management across numerous industries. Their team had deep expertise in helping companies decarbonise -- but the brand didn't reflect the authority or breadth of what they offered.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Authority rooted in action, not rhetoric.
Paragraph 1: The creative direction centred on one principle: [BOLD]credibility through clarity[/BOLD]. While most sustainability brands lean into green cliches and aspirational language, Decarbonaid's identity needed to convey real operational expertise -- the kind built over decades, not pitch decks.
Paragraph 2: The visual system uses a restrained, structured palette and precise typography to communicate strategic rigour. Every element was designed to feel like the brand of advisors who've been in boardrooms -- not a startup chasing trends.
Quote: Decarbonisation is not a trend -- it's an operational reality. The brand needed to feel like decades of expertise, not a marketing campaign.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A brand that signals decades of experience.
Paragraph 1: A complete brand identity system including logo, visual language, website, and client-facing materials. The new brand positioned Decarbonaid as trusted advisors with the authority to guide companies through complex decarbonisation strategies -- from assessment to implementation.

Scope: Visual Identity

SECTION: The Challenge
---
Label: The Challenge
Heading: A conversational AI brand that needed to find its voice -- visually.
Paragraph 1: Blablador is a Barcelona-based AI startup building conversational AI tools for the European market, with a focus on trust and privacy. Their name is playful -- a nod to "blah blah," talking -- but their visual identity was all over the place: mismatched icons, inconsistent colours, and a logo that looked like it was made in a free online tool.
Paragraph 2: They needed a visual system that conveyed both [BOLD]technical sophistication[/BOLD] and the [BOLD]approachable, conversational nature[/BOLD] of their product.

SECTION: The Approach
---
Label: The Approach
Heading: Machine precision meets human conversation.
Paragraph 1: The visual identity plays on the tension between [BOLD]machine precision[/BOLD] and [BOLD]human conversation[/BOLD]. We developed a custom wordmark that blends geometric letterforms with subtle organic curves -- technically crisp but never cold.
Paragraph 2: The colour system uses deep indigo as a primary, with electric violet and warm neutrals as accents. A custom illustration language of abstract speech forms and wave patterns creates visual rhythm across all touchpoints.
Quote: AI brands don't have to look like sci-fi movies. Blablador talks to people -- the brand should feel like a conversation, not a command line.

SECTION: The Outcome
---
Label: The Outcome
Heading: A complete visual system -- from product to brand.
Paragraph 1: A comprehensive visual identity including logo, colour system, typography guidelines, illustration library, UI component palette, website design, and social media templates. The rebrand launched alongside their Series A announcement and helped position Blablador as the leading conversational AI platform in Latin America.
